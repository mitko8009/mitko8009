I’m a **17-year-old** self-taught student, tweaking imperfections with mods and sometimes clashing with ideas along the way.<br>I’m mainly a modder, creating for games like _The Binding of Isaac, Minecraft_, and even platforms like _Shkolo and НЕИСПУО_.<br>I also dive into game development, working on a few projects for competitions. Actually just coding for fun 😛
